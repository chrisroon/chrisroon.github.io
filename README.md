### Personal Website

I create this website using the Foundations 6 CSS Framework along with custom HTML/CSS files. In creating this website I learned the basics of web development and what goes into a website. I also learned about how to make websites responsive. This project was my first experience building a website. This project gave me insight into the complex nature of web development.
