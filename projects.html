        <h2>Odds of Happiness:</h2>
        <p>For this project my fellow researchers and I looked into the odds of happiness based off certain predictors.
        Positive well-being has been associated with overall better health and therefore we found it interesting to see if there were variables which would increase the chance of being happy.
        We gathered our data from the <a href = "https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/" target = "_blank">General Social Survery</a> 
        and selected variables we predicted would be associated with happiness.
        We then created a logistic model to see how our different variables affected the odds of being happy.

        <h2>NBA Analysis:</h2>
        <p>I was curious which defensive statistics were most impactful for a team being succesful in the NBA.
            My data was gathered from the <a href = "https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional?Season=2021-22" target = "_blank">NBA</a> site where they keep more stats than anyone could need.
            I found that effective field goal percentage was the most impactful through simple linear regression.

        <h2>College Students Change in Religious Beliefs:</h2>
        <p>One of my theology classes focused on "lived religion".
            This examines how people actually live out their faith/spirituality in day to day life. 
            For my project in this class I chose to study how UST students perceptions of religon/spirituality changed
            during their time in college. I did this by surveying students and asking how them questions about how
            their views have changed and why. I found that most people had some sort of change in their perceptions as expected.
